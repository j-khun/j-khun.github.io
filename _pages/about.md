<h1>Welcome to my pages!!</h1>
<p>
  I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Yu Kosakaâ€™s group at the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology (RCAST) at The University of Tokyo (UTokyo), Japan.
  I focus on the teleconnection mechanisms linking Arctic and high-latitude climate variability to mid-latitude extreme events, such as heat waves, cold waves, and severe air pollution.
  I am also interested in subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) and global climate modeling of extreme events in high- and mid-latitudes.
  Previously, I worked as a research associate at the Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) and the Earth Environment Research Center at Kongju National University in Korea.
